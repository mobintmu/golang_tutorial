# variable

Go is statically typed, meaning that once a variable type is defined, it can only store data of that type.

# naming Rules

Multi-Word Variable Names

Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read.

There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable:
Camel Case

Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:
myVariableName = "John"
Pascal Case

Each word starts with a capital letter:
MyVariableName = "John"
Snake Case

Each word is separated by an underscore character:
my_variable_name = "John"
